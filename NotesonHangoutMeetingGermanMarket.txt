Notes on Hangout Meeting with Product Experts



- PEs want processes and ways of communication and working to stay the way there are
    > rapid responses in private forum
    > information about changes before roll-out of feature changes or new features in private forum
    > no regular Hangout sessions but a Q&A Hangout after major changes, so they can ask questions directly

- for the moment no demand to promote or engage new PEs

- strong demand for channel of direct communication with me, was done via Gmail so far with previous CM
