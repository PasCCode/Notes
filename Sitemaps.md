# Sitemaps

## Supported Formats

    1. XML
    2. RSS, mRSS & Atom 1.0
    3. Text file (needs to be UTF-8 encoded)
    4. Google site automatically generate a sitemap


## Guidelines

- Google will crawl URLs exactly are they are listed, always use absolute paths

- a sitemap can be posted anywhere on the site, but a sitemap affects onlz descendants of the parent directory

- do not include sessions IDs from URLs in the sitemap to reduce duplicate crawling of those URLs
